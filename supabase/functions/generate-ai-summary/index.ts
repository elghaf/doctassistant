   - Blood glucose monitoring BID, fasting and 2 hours post-dinner
   - Follow-up labs in 3 months: HbA1c, comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel
   - Ophthalmology referral for diabetic retinopathy screening

3. Lifestyle Modifications:
   - Detailed nutrition plan with focus on low-sodium DASH diet
   - Structured exercise program: 30 minutes of moderate activity 5 days/week
   - Weight loss goal of 5-7% of body weight over 6 months

1. We're going to slightly increase your blood pressure medication and add a new diabetes medication that can help your heart too.

2. Let's track your blood pressure at home and check your blood sugar levels twice a day to see how these changes are working.

3. Small changes to your diet can make a big difference - I'll connect you with our nutritionist to create a simple meal plan that works for your lifestyle.

4. Adding just a short 30-minute walk most days can improve your energy levels and help both your blood pressure and blood sugar.

Does this plan sound manageable for you?`;
